[F] [F] [a] [a]

[d]I know you think that I shouldn't still love you,
Or [a]tell you that.
But if [d]I didn't say it, well I'd still have felt it
[a]Where's the sense in that?

I promise [C]I'm not trying to make your life harder
Or re[g]turn to where we were [a]

    [Bb] But I will go down with [F]this ship
    And I won't [g]put my hands up and sur[d]render
    There will be [Bb]no white flag above [F]my door
    I'm in [C]love and always [g]will be

[d]I know I left too much mess and destruction
To come [a]back again
And I caused [d]nothing but trouble
I understand if you can't [a]talk to me again

[C] And if you live by the rules of "it's over"
Then I'm [g]sure that that makes sense [a]

    I will go down with this ship

And when we [F]meet
Which I'm sure we will
All that was [a]there
Will be there still
I'll let it [Bb]pass
And hold my tongue
And you will [C]think
That I've moved on....

    I will go down with this ship

    I will go down with this ship
