[G]I [C]close [G]my [a]eyes
[G]Only for a [d7]moment and the [a]moment's gone [G]
[C]All [G]my [a]dreams
[G]Pass before my [d7]eyes with curi[a]osity

    [G/F#] D[G]ust in the [a]wind[a/G]
    [G/F#]All they are is [G]dust in the [a]wind

Same old song
Just a drop of water in an endless sea
All we do
Crumbles to the ground, though we refuse to see

    Dust in the wind (Aa aa aa)
    All we are is dust in the wind
    (Oo oo oo)

Don't hang on
Nothin' last forever but the earth and sky
It slips away
And all your money won't another minute buy

    Dust in the wind
    All we are is dust in the wind (All we are is dust in the wind)
    Dust in the wind (Everything is dust in the wind)
    All we are is dust in the wind
