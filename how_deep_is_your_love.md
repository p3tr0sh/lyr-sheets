[G] [Gmaj7] [Cmaj7] [D7]
[G] [Gmaj7] [Cmaj7] [D7]

I know your [G]eyes in the [b7]morning [C6]sun
[E7]I feel you [a7]touch me in the [B7]pouring [D7]rain
And the [G]moment that you [b7]wander [e7]far from me
I wanna [a7]feel you in my arms a[D7]gain

And you [Cmaj7]come to me on a [b7]summer breeze
Keep me [a7]warm in your love then you [c6]softly leave
And it's [b7]me you need to [D7]show

    How deep is your [G]love
    How deep is your love, How [Gmaj7]deep is your love
    [Cmaj7]I really mean to [c6]learn
    'Cause we're [G]living in a world of [d6]fools
    Breaking us [E7]down
    When they all should let us [a7]be
    We be[c6]long to you and [G]me

I be[b7]lieve in [C6]you
[E7]You know the [a7]door to my [B7]very [D7]soul
You're the [G]light in my [b7]deepest [e7]darkest hour
You're my [a7]saviour when I [D7]fall

And you [Cmaj7]may not think I [b7]care for you
When you [a7]know down inside that I [c6]really do
And it's [b7]me you need to [D7]show

    How deep is your love

(Instrumental Verse)

And you [Cmaj7]come to me on a [b7]summer breeze
Keep me [a7]warm in your love then you [c6]softly leave
And it's [b7]me you need to [D7]show

    How deep is your love
