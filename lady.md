[e9]Lady [e]
Hear me [e9]tonight [e]
'Cos my _fee_ling
Is just _so_ right
As we [C5-]dance [C]
By the [C5-]moonlight [C]
Can't you [a6]see [a7]
You're my [a6]delight [a7]

Lady
I just feel like
I won't get you
Out of my mind
I feel loved
For the first time
And I _know_ that it's _true_
I can _tell_ by the _look_ in your _eyes_

    x3

Lady
Hear me tonight
'Cos my feeling
Is just so right

Lady
I just feel like
I feel loved
For the first time

Lady
Hear me tonight
Can't you see
You're my delight
