| [E] [B] [c#] [A] |

[E] I look at you and time turns[B] to fate
[c#] And you smile
To that[A] boy that thinks to much

[E] Broken in silenc[B]e I adore yo[c#]u
But I'll wait for you
With all those[A] words that you fear most

[E] And I'll breathe out my [B]name
So loud unto [c#]you
Cause Im loaded by [A]you

    But I'm [-]broken by [E]you
    I'm broken by [B]you
    I'm broken by [c#]you
    I'm broken by [A]you
    But I'm [-]broken by [E]you

But smile look alive, don't claim you're b[B]etter
[c#]Oh and don't speak out
With all those[A] words that you fear most

[E] But I'll breathe out my [B]name I would
So loud unto [c#]you if I could
Cause Im loaded by [A]you

    But I'm broken by [E]you
    I'm broken by [B]you
    I'm broken by [c#]you
    I'm broken by [A]you
    Ohoho[E]ho
    Ohoho[B]ho
    Ohoho[c#]ho
    Ohoho[A]ho [-]

[E] And still Im loosing [B]you
And everything you [c#]do
I'm loosing [A]you

    But I'm broken by [E]you...

    I'm broken by [E]you
