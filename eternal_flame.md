[G]Close your [e]eyes, [C]give me your [D]hand, darling
[G]Do you [e]feel my heart [C]beating
[D]Do you under[e]stand
Do you [b]feel the [e]same
[A]Am I only [D]drea[b]ming
[Asus2]Is this burning [C]an eternal flame


[G]I be[e]lieve it's [C]meant to [D]be, darling
[G]I watch you [e]when you are [C]sleeping
[D]You belong with [e]me
Do you [b]feel the [e]same
[A]Am I only [D]drea[b]ming
[C]Or is this burning an eternal flame


[D]Say my [Asus2]name, [e]sun shines through the rain
A whole [F]life so [G]lonely
And then you [C]come and [G]ease the [a]pain
[D]I don't want to lose this [F]fee[C]ling [Dsus2]ooooooooh

Close your eyes...
