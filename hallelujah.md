# Hallelujah
## Leonard Cohen
### C

---

I [C]heard there was a [a]secret chord
That [C]David played and it [a]pleased the Lord
But [F]you don't really [G]care for music, [C]do you?[G]
Well it [C]goes like this the [F]fourth, the [G]fifth
The [a]minor fall and the [F]major lift
The [G]baffled king com[E7]posing Halle[a]lujah

    Halle[F]lujah
    Halle[a]lujah
    Halle[F]lujah
    Halle[C]l[G]u[C]jah[G]

Well your [C]faith was strong but you [a]needed proof
You [C]saw her bathing [a]on the roof
Her [F]beauty and the [G]moonlight over[C]threw you[G]
She [C]tied you to her [F]kitchen [G]chair
She [a]broke your throne and she [F]cut your hair
And [G]from your lips she [E7]drew the Halle[a]lujah

    Hallelujah

[C]Baby I've been [a]here before
I [C]know this room, I've [a]walked this floor
I [F]used to live a[G]lone before I [C]knew you[G]
And I've [C]seen your flag on the [F]marble [G]arch
[a]Love is not a [F]victory march
It's a [G]cold and it's a [E7]broken Halle[a]lujah

    Hallelujah
