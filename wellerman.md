There [a]once was a ship that [a]put to sea
And the [d]name of that ship was the [a]Billy o' Tea
The [a]winds blew hard, her [a]bow dipped down
[E7]Blow, me bully boys, [a]blow (Huh!)

    [F]Soon may the [C]Wellerman come
    To [d]bring us sugar and [a]tea and rum
    [F]One day, when the [C]tonguin' is done
    We'll [E7]take our leave and [a]go

She _had_ not been two _weeks_ from shore
When _down_ on her a _right_ whale bore
The _captain_ called all _hands_ and swore
He'd _take_ that whale in _tow_ (Hah!)

    Soon may the Wellerman come ...

Be_fore_ the boat had _hit_ the water
The _wha_le's tail came _up_ and caught her
All _hands_ to the side, har_pooned_ and fought her
When _she_ dived down be_low_ (Huh!)

    Soon may the Wellerman come ...

No _line_ was cut, no _whale_ was freed
The _Captain_'s mind was _not_ on greed
But _he_ belonged to the _whale_man's creed
She _took_ that ship in _tow_ (Huh!)

    Soon may the Wellerman come ...

For _forty_ days, or _even_ more
The _line_ went slack, then _tight_ once more
All _boats_ were lost, there were _only_ four
But _still_ that whale did _go_

    Soon may the Wellerman come ...

As _far_ as I've heard, the _fight_'s still on
The _line_'s not cut and the _whale_'s not gone
The _Wellerman_ makes his a _regular_ call
To en_courage_ the Captain, _crew_, and all

    Soon may the Wellerman come ...

    Soon may the Wellerman come ...
