Baby join me in death
Baby join me in death
Baby join me in death

[g#] We are [F#]so young
our [g#]lives have just [F#]begun
but al[g#]ready we are co[F#]nsidering
es[c#]cape from this [F#]world

and we've waited for so long
for this moment to come
we're so anxious to be together
together in death

    [E] Won't you [c#]die tonight for [g#]love
    Baby join me in [F#]death
    [E] Won't you [c#]di[g#]e
    Baby join me in [F#]death
    [E] Won't you [c#]die tonight for [g#]love
    Baby join me in [F#]death [E] [F#]

This world is a cruel place
and we're here only to lose
so before life tears us apart let
death bless me with you

    Won't you die tonight for love

this life ain't worth living
this life ain't worth living
this life ain't worth living
this life ain't worth living

    [E] Won't you [c#]die tonight for [g#]love
    Baby [F#]join me in death
    [E] Won't you [c#]di[g#]e
    Baby [F#]join me in death
    [E] Won't you [c#]die tonight for [g#]love
    Baby [F#]join me in death
    [E] Baby [F#]join me in [G#]death
