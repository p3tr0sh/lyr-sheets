    W[E]ay [G#]out in the [A]water, see it [a]swimmin' [c#] [B]

I was swimmin' in the Caribbean
Animals were hiding behind the rock
Except a little fish bumped into me
Swear he was trying to talk to me, coy koi

    Where is my mind?

With your feet on the air and your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, yeah
Your head will collapse
If there's nothing in it
And you'll ask yourself

    Where is my mind?

Oh
With your feet on the air and your head on the ground
Oh
Try this trick and spin it, yeah
Oh
Oh
