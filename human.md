[c]Row, row and row, gently so row and row and down you [f]go
Down the stream through the door heaven opens up once [c]more
Swallows you, swallows pain, swallow feelings in my [f]veins
Shallow boy, shallow slave, shallow be thy holy [c]grave
Open arms, open wide, heaven opened up this [f]time
Just for you, just for you we are only human

    [c]Man, here we [Bb]stand
    [Ab]Human
    [f]Doing
    [c]Man, here we [Bb]stand
    [Ab]Human
    [f]Doing

Run, turn the key, through the door up the stairs and down the hall
Through the flames, through the flames heaven opens up once more
Swallows you, swallows pain, swallows us and everything
In the end, in the end we are only human

    Man, here we stand
    Human
    Doing
    Man, here we stand
    Human
    Doing

    [c]I'll be your stepping stone
    [Bb]I'll be your stepping stone
    [Ab]I'll be your
    [f]I'll be your
    [c]I'll be your stepping stone
    [Bb]I'll be your stepping stone
    [Ab]I'll be your
    [f]I'll be your

    Man, here we stand
    Human
    Doing
    Man, here we stand
    Human
    Doing
