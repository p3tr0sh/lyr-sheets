[D]The lunatic is on the [G7]grass
[D]The lunatic is on the [G7]grass
[D]Remembering games and [D/E]daisy chains and laughs
[A7]Got to keep the loonies on the [D]path[Dsus2]

The lunatic is in the hall
The lunatics are in my hall
The paper holds their folded faces to the floor
And every day the paper boy brings more

    [G]And if the dam breaks open [A]many years too soon
    And [C]if there is no room upon the [G]hill
    And if your head explodes with [A]dark forebodings too
    I'll [C]see you on the dark side of the [G]moon [b] [e] [A]

The lunatic is in my head
The lunatic is in my head
You raise the blade, you make the change
You re-arrange me 'til I'm sane

You lock the door and throw away the key
There's someone in my head but it's not me.

    And if the cloud bursts thunder in your ear
    You shout and no one seems to hear
    And if the band you're in starts playing different tunes
    I'll see you on the dark side of the moon

(I can't think of anything to say except...
I think it's marvelous! Ha, ha, ha! )

| [D] [C] [Bb] [A] |

[D]All that you touch
And [C]all that you see
[Bb]All that you taste
[A]All you feel

And all that you love
And all that you hate
All you distrust
All you save

And all that you give
And all that you deal
And all that you buy,
Beg, borrow or steal

And all you create
And all you destroy
And all that you do
And all that you say

And all that you eat
And everyone you meet
And all that you slight
And everyone you fight

And all that is now
And all that is gone
And all that's to come
And everything under the sun is in tune
But the sun is eclipsed by the moon.

(There is no dark side of the moon, really.
Matter of fact, it's all dark.)
