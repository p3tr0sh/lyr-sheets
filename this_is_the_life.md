| [a] [F] [C] [e] |

Oh the [a]wind whistles down
The [F]cold dark street tonight
And the [C]people they were dancing
[e]To the music vibe

And the [a]boys chase the girls with the curls in their hair
While the [F]shy tormented youth sit way over there
And the [C]songs get louder each one better than be[e]fore

    And you're singing the [a]songs thinking this is the life
    And you wake up in the [F]morning and your head feels twice the size
    Where you gonna go, [C]where you gonna go, where you gonna sleep to[e]night?
    And you're singing the [a]songs thinking this is the life
    And you wake up in the [F]morning and your head feels twice the size
    Where you gonna go, [C]where you gonna go, where you gonna sleep to[e]night?
    Where you gonna sleep to[a]night? [F] [C] [e]

So you're heading down the road in your taxi for 4
And you're waiting outside Jimmy's front door
But nobody's in and nobody's home 'til 4
So you're sitting there with nothing to do
Talking about Robert Riger and his motley crew
And where you gonna go, where you gonna sleep tonight?

    [3x]And you're singing the [a]songs thinking this is the life...

    Where you gonna sleep to[a]night?
