You [F]have my heart, And we'll never be [C]worlds apart
Maybe in [E]magazines, But you'll still [a]be my star
Baby, 'cause [F]in the dark
You can't see [C]shiny cars
And that's when you [E]need me there
With you I'll [a]always share, because

    [F]When the sun shines, we'll shine to[C]gether
    Told you I'd be here for[G]ever
    Said I'll always be your [a]friend
    Took an oath I'mma stick it out 'til the [F]end
    Now that it's raining more than [C]ever
    Know that we'll still have each [G]other
    You can stand under my umb[a]rella
    You can stand under my umb[F]rella (Ella ella eh [C]eh eh)
    Under my umb[G]rella (Ella ella eh [a]eh eh)
    Under my umb[F]rella (Ella ella eh [C]eh eh)
    Under my umb[G]rella (Ella ella eh [a]eh eh eh eh eh)

These fancy things, will never come in between
You're part of my entity, here for infinity
When the war has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard, together we'll mend your heart, because

    When the sun shines, we'll shine together...

[Bb]You can run into my arms
[F]It's OK, don't be alarmed
Come [C]here to me
(There's no distance in between [G]ou[a]r [Bb]love)
So go on and let the rain [F]pour
I'll be all you need and [E]more, because

    When the sun shines, we'll shine together...
