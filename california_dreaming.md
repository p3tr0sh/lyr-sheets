[E7] All the leaves are [a]brown[G][F] and the [G]sky is [E7sus4]grey[E7]
[F]I've been for a [C]walk[E7][a] on a [F]winters [E7sus4]day[E7]
I'd be safe and warm if I was in LA
California dreaming on such a winters day

Stepped into a church I passed along the way
well, I got down on my knees and i pretended to pray
you know the preacher likes the cold he knows I'm gonna stay
California dreaming on such a winters day

Instrumental

All the leaves a brown and the sky is grey
I've been for a walk on a winters day
If I didn't tell her I could leave today
California dreaming on such a winters day
