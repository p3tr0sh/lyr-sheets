All my [G]bags are packed, I'm [C]ready to go
I'm [G]standing here out[C]side your door
I [G]hate to wake you [C]up to say good-[D]bye
But the dawn is breaking, it's early morn
The taxi's waiting He's blowing his horn
Already I'm so lonesome I could die


    So kiss me and smile for me, tell me that you'll wait for me
    Hold me like you'll never let me go
    'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane, don't know when I'll be back again
    Oh, babe, I hate to go

There's so many times I've let you down, so many times I've played around
I tell you now they don't mean a thing
Every place I go I'll think of you, every song I sing I'll sing for you
When I come back, I'll bring your wedding ring

    So kiss me and smile for me, tell me that you'll wait for me

Now the time has come to leave you, one more time let me kiss you
Then close your eyes, I'll be on my way
Dream about the days to come when I won't have to leave alone
About the times I won't have to say

    Kiss me and smile for me, tell me that you'll wait for me
    Hold me like you'll never let me go
    'Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane, don't know when I'll be back again
    Oh, babe, I hate to go
    I'm leaving on a jet plane, don't know when I'll be back again
    Oh, babe, I hate to go
