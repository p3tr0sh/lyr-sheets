[e]Take me back to my boat on the river
I [D]need to go down, I [B7]need to come down
[e]Take me back to my boat on the river
And [D]I won't cry out any [e]more
Time stands still as I gaze In her waters
She eases me down, touching me gently
With the waters that flow past my boat on the river
So I don't cry out anymore

Oh the [D]river is wide
The [B]river it touches my [e]life like the waves on the [A]sand
And [a]all roads lead to Tran[e]quillity Base
Where the [F#7]frown on my face disa[B]ppears
[e]Take me down to my boat on the river
And [D]I won't cry [B]out any[e]more

[e][D][B7][e][D][B7][e]

Oh the [D]river is deep
The [B7]river it touches my [e]life like the waves on the [A]sand
And [a]all roads lead to Tran[e]quillity Base
Where the [F#7]frown on my face disa[B]ppears

[e]Take me down to my boat on the river
I [D]need to go down
Won't you [B7]let me go down?
[e]Take me back to my boat on the river
And [D]I won't cry out any[e]more
And [D]I won't cry out any[e]more
And [B7]I won't cry out any[e]more
