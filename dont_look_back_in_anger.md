|[C]|[F]|[C]|[F]|

[C]Slip inside the [G]eye of your [a]mind
Don't you [E]know you might [F]find
[G]A better place to [C]play? [a] [G]
[C]You said that [G]you'd never [a]been
But all the [E]things that you've [F]seen
[G]Slowly fade a[C]way [a] [G]

    [F]So I start a revo[f]lution from my [C]bed
    'Cause you [F]said the brains I [f]had went to my [C]head
    [F]Step outside, [f]summertime's in [C]bloom
    [G]Stand up beside the fireplace
    [E7/G#]Take that look from off your face
    [a]You ain't ever [G]gonna burn my [F]heart out [G] [G]

    And [C]so, [G]Sally can [a]wait
    She [E]knows it's too [F]late as we're [G]walking on [C]by [a] [G]
    Her [C]soul [G]slides a[a]way [E]
    But don't look [F]back in anger, [G]I heard you [C]say

[G] [a] [E] [F] [G] [C] [a] [G]

Take me to the place where you go
Where _no_body _knows_ if it's night or day
Please don't put your life in the hands
Of a rock 'n' roll band
Who'll throw it all away

    I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed

    And so, Sally can wait ...

    (Pre-Chorus / Solo)

    So, Sally can wait ...

    So, Sally can wait
    She knows it's too late as she's walking on by
    My soul slides away
    But don't look [F]back in anger, don't look [f]back in anger
    I heard you [C]say [G] [a] [E] [F] [f]
    At least not to[C]day
