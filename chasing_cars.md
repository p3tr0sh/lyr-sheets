| [A] [E] [D] [A] |

[A] We'll do it all [E]
Everything [D]
On our own [A]

We don't need
Anything
Or anyone

    If I lay [A]here
    If I just [E]lay here
    Would you lie [D]with me and just forget the world?[A]

I _don't_ quite know
How to say
How I feel

Those three words
Are _said_ too much
They're _not_ enough

    If I lay here
    If I just lay here
    Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

    Forget what we're told
    Before we get too old
    Show me a _garden_ that's bursting into life

Let's waste time
Chasing cars
Around our heads

    If I lay here
    If I just lay here
    Would you lie with me and just forget the world?

    All that I am
    All that I ever was
    Is here in your perfect eyes, they're all I can see

    I don't know where
    Confused about how as well
    Just know that these things will never change for us at all

    If I lay here
    If I just lay here
    Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
