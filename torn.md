[F] I thought I saw a man brought to life [a]
He was warm, he came around like he was [Bb]dignified
He showed me what it was to cry [F]

Well, you couldn't be that man I adored [a]
You don't seem to know
Seem to care what your [Bb]heart is for
But I don't know him anymore

    There's [d]nothing where he used to lie
    [C]My conversation has run dry
    [a]That's what's going on
    [C]Nothing's fine, I'm [F]torn

    I'm all out of [C]faith
    This is how I [d]feel
    I'm cold and I am [Bb]shamed
    Lying naked on the [F]floor
    Illusion never [C]changed
    Into something [d]real
    I'm wide awake and [Bb]I can see
    The perfect sky is [F]torn
    You're a little [C]late, I'm already [d]torn [Bb]

[F] So I guess the fortune teller's right [a]
I should have seen just what was there
And not some [Bb]holy light
But you _crawled_ beneath my veins, and now

    I don't care, I have no luck
    I don't miss it all that much
    There's just so many things
    That I can't touch, I'm torn

    I'm all out of faith...
    ... You're a little [C]late,
    I'm already [d]torn,[Bb] [d]torn [Bb]

[d] [d] [F] [C]

    There's nothing where he used to lie
    My inspiration has run dry
    That's what's going on
    Nothing's right, I'm torn

    I'm all out of faith
    This is how I feel
    I'm cold and I am shamed
    Lying naked on the floor
    Illusion never changed
    Into something real
    I'm wide awake and I can see
    The perfect sky is torn

    I'm all out of faith
    This is how I feel
    I'm cold and I'm ashamed
    Bound and broken on the floor
    You're a little late, I'm already torn, torn
