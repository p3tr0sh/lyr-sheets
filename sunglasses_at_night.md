[bb] [bb6] [F#] [G#]

[bb]I wear my sunglasses at [bb6]night
So I can, So I can
[F#]Watch you weave then [G#]breathe your story [bb]lines
And I wear my sunglasses at [bb6]night
So I can, So I can
[F#]Keep track of the [G#]visions in my [bb]eyes

    While, [F#]she's de[G#]ceiving me,
    [F#]It cuts my se[G#]curity (has)
    [F#]she got con[G#]trol of me
    I [F#]turn to her and [G#]say

    [bb]Don't switch the blade on the guy in shades; oh [F#]no
    [bb]Don't masquerade with the guy in shades;
    (oh [F#]no) (I can't believe it)
    [bb]You got it made with the guy in shades; oh [F#]no [d#]

I wear my sunglasses at night
So I can, So I can
Forget my name while you collect your claim
And I wear my sunglasses at night
So I can, So I can
See the light that's right before my eyes

    While she's deceiving me...

    Don't switch the blade on the guy in shades (oh no)
    Don't masquerade with the guy in shades
    (oh no) (I can't believe it)
    don't be afraid of the guy in shades
    (oh No) (It can't escape you)
    (cus) You got it made with the guy in shades (oh no)

I said
I wear my sunglasses at night
I wear my sunglasses at night
I wear my sunglasses at night

I say to ya now
I wear my sunglasses at night
I wear my sunglasses at night
I wear my sunglasses at night

I cry to you
I wear my sunglasses at night
I wear my sunglasses at night
