[a] | [d] [F] [Bbmaj7] [a]

One in four chil[d]dren, living in this [F]world, live in doubt & [Bbmaj7]pain, are living day to [a]day
Don’t you have no shame, or see that it ain’t right, don’t you feel at all, can’t you hear tonight
What if love could be – not of I but us – simple as it seems, still we seem to crush,
Dreams which are in flames, does your spirit wane, weighed down by the chains, battered by the rain….

[Bb]Oh you’re giving me nothing but [d]reasons, I don't want to [C]hear, dealing in nothing but [g]hatred, I don’t share your [Bb]fear
Telling me words don’t [d]matter, Truth is on the [C]wane, I don’t buy your [g]bullshit, you do not not speak in my name [Bb] [a]

I am of the earth, I am of the streams, I am from my birth, living for the dream
Of a better world, for the blood lit sky, for the blazing sun, blazing in my eyes

Oh you’re giving me nothing but reasons, I can’t seem hear, dealing in nothin hatred, I don’t share your fear –
Telling me words don’t matter, Truth is on the wane, I don’t buy your bullshit , you do not not speak in my name
I can see your heart, weary in the gloom, battling with the dark, like a crescent moon,
Are you gonna fade, or are you gonna rise, are you with the change, or are you with the tide….

Oh you’re giving me nothing but reasons, I can’t seem hear, dealing in nothin hatred, I don’t share your fear –
Telling me words don’t matter, Truth is on the wane, I don’t buy your bullshit , you do not not speak in my name

Yes I still choose love
