[a] [|] [d] [F] [Bbmaj7] [a] [|]

One in four chil[d]dren, living in this [F]world
Live in doubt & [Bbmaj7]pain, are living day to [a]day
Don’t you have no shame, or see that it ain’t right
Don’t you feel at all, can’t you hear tonight
What if love could be – not of I but us
Simple as it seems, still we seem to crush,
Dreams which are in flames, does your spirit wane
Weighed down by the chains, battered by the rain….

    [Bb]Oh you’re giving me nothing but [d]reasons, I don't want to [C]hear
    Dealing in nothing but [g]hatred, I don’t share your [Bb]fear
    Telling me words don’t [d]matter, Truth is on the [C]wane
    I don’t buy your [g]bullshit, you do not speak in [Bb]my name [a]

I am of the earth, I am of the streams
I am from my birth, living for the dream
Of a better world, for the blood lit sky
For the blazing sun, blazing in my eyes

    [Bb]Oh you’re giving me nothing but [d]reasons, I don't want to [C]hear
    Dealing in nothing but [g]hatred, I don’t share your [Bb]fear
    Telling me words don’t [d]matter, Truth is on the [C]wane
    I don’t buy your [g]bullshit, you do not not speak in [Bb]my name [a]

I can see your heart, weary in the gloom
Battling with the dark, like a crescent moon,
Are you gonna fade, or are you gonna rise
Are you with the change, or are you with the tide….

    [Bb]Oh you’re giving me nothing but [d]reasons, I don't want to [C]hear
    Dealing in nothing but [g]hatred, I don’t share your [Bb]fear
    Telling me words don’t [d]matter, Truth is on the [C]wane
    I don’t buy your [g]bullshit, you do not not speak in [Bb]my name [a]

Yes I still choose love
