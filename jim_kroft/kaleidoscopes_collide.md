|| [a](whistle)[a] [G] [D] ||

Ka[a]leidoscopes collide, I am [a]living in the sky
[G]Ain't no telling if I [D]live or I die
[a]Yeah I got a crush, can you [a]come and give me love
[G]Still I give a nod to the [D]dents I'm dreamin of

Ou[a]oh ou[a]oh ou[G]oh oh [D]oh

Rainbow in my view, do you promise something new
I am the fool for ever trusting you
If have a sign show me it sometime
I could use a guide cause the world is far too wide

Ouoh ouoh ouoh oh oh
Ouoh ouoh ouoh oh oh

    [D][-]And as kaleidoscopes col[C]lide in[G]to our [D]lives
    I hope the stars will be our [C]guides to[G]night to[D]night

(whistle)

Scaling an abyss descending through the mist
I'm living nowhere the land is at your (...)
Clouds are seeming new from the battles that you drew
Still I'm mesmerized by the speed I'm falling through

Ouoh ouoh ouoh oh oh
Ouoh ouoh ouoh oh oh

    And as kaleidoscopes collide into our lives
    I hope the stars will be our guide tonight tonight
    I see the rain is coming down to wash away
    All of the feels that bring us down tonight tonight

Lalalala lalalala
La lalala la la
Lalalala lalalala (and as kaleidoscopes collide)
La lalala la la
