[D*]Oh, though I got no place to [C]go [G]
[D*]Oh, though I got no hand to [C]hold [G]
[D*]Oh, I got a lot to [C]give [G]
A[D*]gain? I seem to get to [C]live [G]
[C]One thing, one thing, one thiiiiiiing

    [a]Try to reach the [e]earth
    [F]Teaches me what [C]I'm worth [Cmaj7/B]
    [a]Try to reach the [e]sky
    [F]Celebrate that [C]I'm alive [Cmaj7/B]

Oh, though I'm just a fugitive
Oh, happy that I get to live
Know that there's a beaten road
Down with ???'s son we go

    Try to reach the earth...

    If I pray the storm
    Another time I will belong
    Though I'm a refugee
    I'm human, can't you see?

[D*]OoOoOo[C]Oohhhh [G]
[D*]OoOoOo[C]Oohhhh [G]
[D*]OoOoOo[C]Oohhhh [G]
[D*]OoOoOo[C]Oohhhh [G]

    Try to reach the earth [2x]
