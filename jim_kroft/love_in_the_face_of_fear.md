||[d] [C] [Bb] [a]||

[d]It took a long long [C]time from [Bb]empire's rise to [a]fallen skies
[d]But at last we're [C]here and the [Bb]world is ready for [a]new ideas

    [g]And I know my attitude dis[C]turbs you and [Bb]so it should
    [g]And I know my fantasies are [C]troubling to [Bb]those like you
    [C]Took a very very long [d]time [C]oo[g]hoo
    But my message is [a]clear

    Keep loving in the face of [d]fear
    Keep [C]shouting that you are [Bb]here
    [a]Talking 'bout those i[d]deas
    [C]Loving whether far or [Bb]near [a]oooh

Can you find your place
Where kaleidoscopes are breaking shade
There's a dream I breed from loving man and those in need

    And I know my attitude...

    Keep loving in the face of fear
    Keep shouting that you are here
    Talking 'bout those ideas
    Loving whether far or near
    Loving in the face of fear
    Shouting that you are here
    Loving in the face of fear

It's the [d]fight of your [C]life
Are you [Bb]standing for your [a]right
It's the fight of your life
Are you standing for your right
It's the fight of your life
Are you standing for your right
It's the fight of your life
Are you standing for your right

    Keep loving in the face
    Keep loving in the face
