    Don't you know that I've been dreaming?
    Don't you know that I've been searching?
    Every day through the ups and downs I find
    I am alive

    Facing the fires


Looking at the scars that line my heart
They're the wounds that taught me how to love
I wouldn't have it any other way in life
Through the pain dark turns to light
