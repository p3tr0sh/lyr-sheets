# Fields of Gold

You'll [b]remember me when the [G]west wind moves
Up_on_ the fields of [D]barley
You'll for[b]get the sun in his [G]jealous [D]sky
As we [G]walk in [A]fields of [b]gold [D]

So she took her love for to gaze awhile
Upon the fields of barley
In his arms she fell as her hair came down
Among the fields of [D]gold

Will you stay with me, will you be my love
Among the fields of barley
We'll forget the sun in his jealous sky
As we lie in fields of [b]gold [D]

See the west wind move like a lover so
Upon the fields of barley
Feel her body rise when you kiss her mouth
Among the fields of gold

    [D]I never made promises lightly
    And there have been some that I've broken
    But I swear in the days still left
    We'll [b]walk in [A]fields of [D]gold
    We'll [b]walk in [A]fields of [D]gold

[Interlude]

Many years have passed since those summer days
Among the fields of barley
See the children run as the sun goes down
Among the fields of gold

You'll remember me when the west wind moves
Upon the fields of barley
You can tell the sun in his jealous sky
When we walked in fields of gold
When we walked in fields of gold
When we walked in fields of gold
