[C*]

There are [a/C]nine million bicycles in Bei[e]jing
That's a [d]fact, It's a [F]thing we can't deny
Like the [d]fact that I will [G7]love you till I [C]die.

We are [a/C]twelve billion light years from the [e]edge,
That's a [d]guess, No-one can [F]ever say it's true
But I [d]know that I will [G7]always be with [C]you.


    I'm [f]warmed by the [C]fire of your [G7]love every[a]day
    So [F7]don't call me a [a]liar, just be[D7]lieve everything that I [G]say

There are [a/C]six billion people in the [e]world
More or [d]less, and it [F]makes me feel quite small
But [d]you're the one I [G7]love the most of [C]all

[a/C] [e] [d] [F]
[d] [G7] [C] [C*]

    We're [f]high on the [C]wire, with the [G7]world in our [a]sight
    And [F7]I'll never [a]tire, of the [D7]love that you give me every [G]night

There are [a/C]nine million bicycles in Bei[e]jing
That's a [d]fact, It's a [F]thing we can't deny
Like the [d]fact that I will [G7]love you till I [C*1/2]die.

And there are [d]nine million [G7]bicycles in Bei[C*1/2]jing
And you [d]know that I will [G7]love you till I [C*]die!
