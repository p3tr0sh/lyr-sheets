[C] [d] [F] [d] [C] [d] [F] [d] [C]

There are [a]nine million bicycles in Bei[e]jing
That's a [d]fact, It's a [F]thing we can't deny
Like the [d]fact that I will love you till I [C]die. 

We are [a]twelve billion light years from the [e]edge,
That's a [d]guess, No-one can [F]ever say it's true
But I [d]know that I will always be with [C]you. 


I'm [f]warmed by the [C]fire of your [f]love every[a]day
So [f]don't call me a [a]liar, Just be[d]lieve everything that I [G]say 

There are six billion people in the world 
More or less, and it makes me feel quite small 
But you're the one I love the most of all 

[a] [e] [d] [F] [d] [C] [F] [C] [d] [C]

We're [f]high on the [C]wire, with the [f]world in our [a]sight
And [f]I'll never [a]tire, Of the [d]love that you give me every [G]night 

    There are nine million bicycles in Beijing...

And there are [d]nine million bicycles in Bei[C]jing [F]
And you [d]know that I will [F]love you till I [C]die! [d] [F] [C]
