[G] Shine bright like a diamond [b]
[A] Shine bright like a diamond

[G]Find light in the beautiful [b]sea
I choose to be happy [A]
You and I, you and I
We're like diamonds in the [G]sky

You're a shooting star I [b]see
A vision of ecstasy [A]
When you hold me, I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the [G]sky

I knew that we'd become one right away
Oh, right away
At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

    So shine [G]bright to[b]night, you and [A]I
    We're beautiful like diamonds in the [G]sky
    Eye to [b]eye, so a[A]live
    We're beautiful like diamonds in the [G]sky

    [G]Shine bright like a diamond
    [b]Shine bright like a diamond
    [A]Shine bright like a diamond
    We're beautiful like diamonds in the [G]sky

    Shine bright like a diamond...

Palms rise to the universe
As we moonshine and molly
Feel the warmth, we'll never die
We're like diamonds in the sky

You're a shooting star I see
A vision of ecstasy
When you hold me, I'm alive
We're like diamonds in the sky

At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays
I saw the life inside your eyes

    So shine bright tonight, you and I...

    Shine bright like a diamond... (x2)

    Shine bright like a diamond
    Shine bright like a diamond
    Shine bright like a diamond

    So shine bright tonight, you and I...

    Shine bright like a diamond
    Shine bright like a diamond
    Shine bright like a diamond
    Oh, yeah
    Shine bright like a diamond
    Shine bright like a diamond
    Shine bright like a diamond
    Shine bright like a diamond
