[E]

[E]Tell me again about how it hurts
[a]Being awfully loud for an introvert
[E]Get out of my room, smile wiped clean
[a]Isn't it weird to be so mean?

[E]I'm guessing that I've grown horns
I guess I'm human no more
[a]I can tell I've rotted in your brain
Oh, [E]how easily passion twists
You think I'm a crazy bitch
I [a]craft my words to fit your head
'Cause [C]no one listens [D]to the [E]dead

    [E]So maybe I will talk to you
    [E7]The only way I know how to
    [A]Mmm, mmm, I've said my speech
    Mmm, mmm, through sharpened teeth
    You [a]break the rules
    And spikes grow from your [C]skin
    Please [D]let the devil [E]in

A meter apart
You blankly stare
We shout in our heads
Are you still in there?
Well this ends bad, then
We knew it would
So we won't eat our words
'Cause they don't taste good

I'm guessing that I've grown horns
I guess I'm human no more
I can tell I've rotted in your brain
Oh, how easily passion twists
You think I'm a crazy bitch
A thousand words are left unsaid
'Cause no one listens to the dead

    So maybe I will talk to you
    The only way I know how to
    Mmm, mmm, I've said my speech
    Mmm, mmm, through sharpened teeth
    You break the rules
    And spikes grow from your skin

    Oh, I think it might be worth a try
    Oh, am I ready to let this die?
    Mmm, mmm, a monster's here
    Mmm, mmm, you plug your ears
    But hey, you might just listen to it sing
    Please let the devil in

    [E]We won't eat our [E7]words
    [A]They don't taste so [a]good [x4]

    Look, I know that I've seen this before
    High and mighty, at the top of your list
    Adoring every move, now my rank is sinking
    But we're both guilty of black or white thinking
    And through my red eyes, you look pale
    All of your scars are looking more like scales
    Two ugly creatures, two sinister preachers
    Blind to the past, like a couple of monsters;
    Just a couple of monsters!

    So maybe I will talk to you...

    Oh, I think it might be worth a try...

    [E]We won't eat our [E7]words
    [A]They don't taste so [a]good [x2]
