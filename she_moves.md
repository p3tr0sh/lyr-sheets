[b]Far away, far a[e]way in the [D]land where the sun will never [C]rise
[b]Far away, far a[e]way in the [D]place with marmalade [C]skies
[b]Far away, far a[e]way in the [D]land where the sun will hide its [C]eyes
[b]Far away, far a[e]way in the [D]place with marmalade [D7]skies

    [G]All alone she [b]moves
    In[e]to a broken paradise sur[D]rounded by the colored lights
    [G]On and on she [b]moves
    In[e]to a paradise without [D]day and without night

Far away, far away in the land where the sun will never rise
Far away, far away in the place with marmalade skies
Carry on, carry on, deeper into the rabbit hole
Carry on, carry on until you reach the hallway made of gold

    All alone she moves
    Into a broken paradise surrounded by the colored lights
    On and on she moves
    Into a paradise without day and without night

[G]Ah, ah, [e]ah [b]
[G]Ah, ah, [b]ah [D]
[G]Ah, ah, [e]ah [b]
[G]Ah, ah, [b]ah [D]

    All alone she moves
    Into a broken paradise surrounded by the colored lights
    On and on she moves
    Into a paradise without day and without night

    All alone she moves
    Into a broken paradise surrounded by the colored lights
    On and on she moves
    Into a paradise without day and without night
