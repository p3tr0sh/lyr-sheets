[c]You and me
We [Bb]used to be to[f]gether
[Bb]Everyday to[g]gether
[f]Alwa[Bb]ys
I [c]really fe[Bb]el
That I'm [f]losing my [Bb]best friend
I [g]can't believe
This [c]could be th[f]e en[Bb]d

It [c]looks as [Bb]though you'[f]re letting [Bb]go
And [Eb]if it's real
Well, [Bb]I don't want to [C]know

    [f]Don't speak
    I [bb]know just what you're [Eb]saying
    [c]So please stop ex[bb]plaining
    Don't [c]tell me 'cause it [f]hurts [bb] [c]
    [f]Don't speak
    I [bb]know what you're [Eb]thinking
    [c]I don't need your [bb]reasons
    Don't [c]tell me 'cause it [f]hurts [bb] [Eb]

Our [c]memories
[Bb]They can be in[f]viting
But some are [Bb]altogether [g]mighty
[f]Frighteni[Bb]ng
[c]As we [Bb]die
Bo[f]th you and [Bb]I
[Eb] With my head in my [Bb]hands
I sit and [C]cry

    Don't speak

It's all ending
We gotta stop pretending who we are

You and me
I can see us dying
Are we?

    Don't speak x2
