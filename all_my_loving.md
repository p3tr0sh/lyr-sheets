Close your [e]eyes and I'll [A7]kiss you
To[D]morrow I'll [b]miss you
Re[G]member I'll [e]always be [C]true[A7]
And then [e]while I'm a[A7]way
I'll write [D]home every [b]day
And I'll [G]send all my [A]loving to [D]you

I'll pretend that I'm kissing
The lips I am missing
And hope that my dreams will come true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home every day
And I'll send all my loving to you

    All my [b]loving [Daug]I will send to [D]you
    All my [b]loving, [Daug]darling I'll be [D]true

Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
Tomorrow I'll miss you
Remember I'll always be true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home every day
And I'll send all my loving to you

    All my loving I will send to you
    All my loving, darling I'll be true
    All my loving, all my loving ooh
    All my loving I will send to you
