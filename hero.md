[C]Let me go
I don't wanna be your [a]he[e]ro
I don't wanna be a [F]big man
Just wanna [C]fight with everyone [G]else

Your [C]masquerade
I don't wanna be a [a]part of your pa[e]rade
Everyone deserves a [F]chance to
[C]Walk with everyone [G]else

While holding down
A job to keep my girl around
And maybe buy me some new strings
And her a night out on the weekend

And we can whisper things
Secrets from our American dreams
Baby needs some protection
But I'm a kid like everyone else

So let me go
I don't wanna be your hero
I don't wanna be a big man
I Just wanna fight like everyone else

Oh

So let me go
I don't wanna be your hero
I don't wanna be a big man
I Just wanna fight with everyone else

Your masquerade
I don't wanna be a part of your parade
Everyone deserves a chance to
Walk with everyone else
