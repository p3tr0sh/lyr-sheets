    [A]Kiss me hard before you [c#]go
    [B]Summertime sad[f#]ness
    [A]I just wanted you to [c#]know
    That, [B]baby, you're the [f#]best

I got my [A]red dress on to[c#]night
Dancing in the [B]dark in the pale moon[f#]light
Done my hair up [A]real big beauty queen [c#]style
High heels [B]off, I'm feeling a[f#]live

    Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
    Telephone _wires_ above are sizzling like a snare
    Honey, _I'm_ on fire, I feel it everywhere
    Nothing scares me anymore

    (1, 2, 3, 4)

    Kiss me hard before you go...

    I got that summertime, summertime sadness
    S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
    Got that summertime, summertime sadness
    Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruising down the coast goin' 'bout 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight

    Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
    Telephone wires above are sizzling like a snare
    Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
    Nothing scares me anymore

    (1, 2, 3, 4)

    Kiss me hard before you go...

    I got that summertime, summertime sadness
    S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
    Got that summertime, summertime sadness
    Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[B]Think I'll miss you for[c#]ever
Like the [f#]stars miss the sun in the [A]morning sky
[B]Later's better than [c#]never
Even [f#]if you're gone I'm gonna [A]drive ([A]drive, [A]drive)

    I got that summertime, summertime sadness
    S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
    Got that summertime, summertime sadness
    Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

    Kiss me hard before you go...

    I got that summertime, summertime sadness
    S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
    Got that summertime, summertime sadness
    Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
