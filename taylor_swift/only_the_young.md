It [D]keeps me awake, the look on your face
The [A]moment you heard the news
You're [e]screaming inside and frozen in time
You [G]did all that you could do
The [D]game was rigged, the ref got tricked
The [A]wrong ones think they're right
You were out[e]numbered â€” this tim[G]e

    But only the [D]young
    Only the [A]young
    Only the [e]young
    Only the [G]young can [D]run [A]
    Can [e]run, so [G]run
    And run, and [D]run

So every day now, you brace for the sound
You've only heard on TV
You go to class, scared, wondering where 
The best hiding spot would be
And the big bad man and his big bad clan
Their hands are stained with red
Oh, how quickly, they forget

[b]They aren't gonna [G]help us
Too busy helping them[b]selves
They aren't gonna [G]change this
We gotta do it our[b]selves
They think that it's [G]over
But it's just be[e]gun
Only one thing can [G]save us

    Only the [D]young (Only the young)
    Only the [A]young (Only the young)
    Only the [e]young (Only the young)
    Only the [G]young

    Only the young (Only the young)
    Only the young (Only the young)
    Only the young (Only the young)
    Only the young

    Only the young (Only the young)
    (Don't say you're too tired to fight
    It's just a matter of time
    Up there's the finish line)
    Only the young (Only the young)
    Only the young (Only the young)
    Only the young
    Can run

    Don't say you're too tired to fight
    It's just a matter of time (Can run)
    Up there's the finish line
    So run, and run, and run
    Don't say you're too tired to fight
    It's just a matter of time (So run)
    Up there's the finish line
    And run, and run, and run

    Only the young
    Only the young
    Only the young
