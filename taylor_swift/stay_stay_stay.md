| [C] [F] [a] [G] |

[C]I'm pretty [F]sure we almost [a]broke up [G]last night.
[C]I threw my [F]phone across the [a]room at [G]you.
[C]I was ex[F]pecting some dra[a]matic [G]turn-away,
But [C]you[F][a] [G]stayed.

This morning I said we should talk about it.
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved.
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet and said
"Okay, let's talk." And I said,

    [C]Stay, stay, [F]stay.
    [a]I've been lovin' [G]you for quite some [C]time, time, [F]time.
    [a]You think that it's [G]funny when I'm [C]mad, mad, [F]mad.
    But [a]I think that it's [G]best if we both[C] stay.[F][a][G]

Before you I'd only dated self-indulgent takers,
Who took all of their problems out on me.
But you carry my groceries, and now I'm always laughin'.
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to...

    Stay, stay, stay.
    I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
    You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.
    But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.

You [a]took the time to memorize me:
My [F]fears, my hopes, and dreams.
I just like hangin' [C]out with you all the [G]time.
[a]All those times that you didn't leave;
It's [F]been occurring to me I'd like to hang [C]out with you for my whole [G]life.

    Stay.
    And I'll be loving you for quite some time.
    No one else is gonna love me, when I get mad, mad, mad.
    So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.

    Stay, stay, stay.
    I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
    You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.
    But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.

    Stay, stay, stay.
    I've been lovin' you for quite some time, time, time.
    You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad.
    But I think that it's best if we both stay.
