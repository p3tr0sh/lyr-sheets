Oh, Caro[b]lina creeks running [A]through my [e]veins
Lost I was born, lonesome I [A]came
Lonesome I'll [b]always stay
Carolina knows why for [A]years I [e]roam
Free as these birds, light as whis[A]pers
Caro[b]lina knows


    And [b]you didn't see me here
    No, they never did see me here
    And she's [D]in [A]my [e]dreams
    Into the mist, into the [D]clouds
    [A]Don't [e]leave
    I make a fist, I make it [D]count
    And there are [A]places I will [e]never, ever go
    [b] And things that [A]only Caro[e]lina will ever [b]know [A] [e] [A] [b]


Carolina stains on the dress she left
Indelible scars, pivotal marks
Blue as the life she fled
Carolina pines, won't you cover me?
Hide me like robes, down the back road
Muddy these webs we weave


    And [b]you didn't see me here
    They never did see me
    And she's [D]in [A]my [e]dreams
    Into the mist, into the [D]clouds
    [A]Don't [e]leave
    I make a fist, I make it [D]count
    And there are [A]places I will [e]never, ever go
    [b] And things that [A]only Carolina will ever [D]know

    [4x][D][A][e]Oh, oh, ooh...[e]


And [b]you didn't see me here
They [A]never did see me here
No, [b]you didn't see me here
They [A]never saw me


Oh, Carolina knows why for years they've said
That I was guilty as sin and sleep in a liar's bed
But the sleep comes fast and I'll meet no ghosts
It's between me, the sand, and the sea
Carolina knows
