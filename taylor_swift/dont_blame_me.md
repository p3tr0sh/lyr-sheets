[a]Don't blame me.
[G]Love made me crazy.
If it [F]doesn't, you ain't doing it right.
[C]Lord, save me.
My [d]drug is my baby
I'll be [a]using for the rest of my life.

[a]I've been [G]breaking hearts a long [F]time and
Toying with them older [C]guys.
Just playthings [d]for me to use. [a] [F] [d]
[a]Something [G]happened for the first t[F]ime in
The darkest little paradise.
[C]Shaking, pacing, [d]I just need you.[a] [F] [d]

For you,
[a/F]I would cross the line,
[G]I would waste my time,
[F]I would lose my mind.
[G]They say, "She's gone too far this time."

    [a]Don't blame me.
    [G]Love made me crazy.
    If it [F]doesn't, you ain't doing it right.
    [C]Lord, save me.
    My [d]drug is my baby
    I'll be [a]using for the rest of my life. [F] [d]

    Don't blame me.
    Love made me crazy.
    If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right.
    Oh, Lord, save me.
    My drug is my baby
    I'll be using for the rest of my life.

My name is whatever you decide,
And I'm just gonna call you mine.
I'm insane, but I'm your baby (your baby).
Echoes (echoes) of your name inside my mind.
Halo, hiding my obsession.
I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy.

And, baby, for you,
I would fall from grace
Just to touch your face.
If you walk away,
I'd beg you on my knees to stay.

    Don't blame me.

I get so high, oh,
Every time you're—every time you're loving me
You're loving me.
Trip of my life, oh,
Every time you're—every time you're touching me.
You're touching me.

[-]Every time you're—every time you're loving me.

Oh, Lord, save me.
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life.
(Using for the rest of my life. Oh!)

    Don't blame me.

I get so high, oh,
Every time you're—every time you're loving me.
You're loving me.
Oh, Lord, save me.
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life.
