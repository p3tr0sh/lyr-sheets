|| [e] | [G] | [D] ([Dsus4]) | [A] ||

[e]Untouchable like a [G]distant diamond [D]sky,[A]
[e]I'm reaching out and I [G]just can't tell you [D]why[A]
I'm caught up in [e]you,[G] I'm caught up in [D]you[A]

[G]Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
[A]And when you're close I feel like coming undone

    In the [D]middle of the night
    When I'm in this dream
    It's like a [A]million little stars
    Spelling out your name
    You gotta [e]come on, come on
    Say that we'll be together
    [G]Come on, come on
    [A]Little taste of Heaven [e] [G] [D] [A] [e] [G] [D] [A]

It's half full, and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway

But you're untouchable,
burning brighter than the sun
And now that you're close
I feel like coming undone

    In the middle of the night
    When I'm in this dream
    It's like a million little stars
    Spelling out your name
    You gotta come on, come on
    Say that we'll be together
    Come on, come on

    Oh, in the middle of the night
    Waking from this dream
    I wanna feel you by my side
    Standing next to me
    You gotta come on, come on
    Say that we'll be together
    Come on, come on
    Little taste of Heaven

I'm caught up in you. Oh, oh.

But you're untouchable,
burning brighter than the sun
Now that you're close
I feel like coming undone

    In the middle of the night
    When I'm in this dream
    It's like a million little stars
    Spelling out your name
    You gotta come on, come on
    Say that we'll be together
    Come on, come on, oh, oh

    In the middle of the night
    When I'm in this dream
    It's like a million little stars
    Spelling out your name
    You gotta come on, come on
    Say that we'll be together
    Come on, come on, come on

    In the middle of the night
    Waking from this dream
    I wanna feel you by my side
    Standing next to me
    You gotta come on, come on
    Say that we'll be together
    Come on, come on
    Little taste of Heaven

    In the middle of the night
    When I'm in this dream
    It's like a million little stars
    Spelling out your name
    You gotta come on, come on
    Come on, come on
    Come on, come on

    Like a million little stars
    Spelling out your name
    Spelling out your name
