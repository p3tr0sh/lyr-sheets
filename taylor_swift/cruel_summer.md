[G](Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[C]Fever dream high in the [D]quiet of the night
You [b]know that I caught it (You're [e]right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (You're right, I want it)

Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the [C]dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't [D]kill me makes me want you more

    And it's [G]new, the shape of your body
    It's [b]blue, the feeling I've got
    And it's [e]ooh, whoa oh
    It's a [C]cruel summer
    It's [G]cool, that's what I tell 'em
    No [b]rules in breakable heaven
    But [e]ooh, whoa oh
    It's a [C]cruel summer
    With [G]you (Yeah, yeah)

Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (You're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (You're right, I want it)

So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know

    Oh, it's new, the shape of your body

I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
He looks up, grinning like a devil

    And it's new, the shape of your body

I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
