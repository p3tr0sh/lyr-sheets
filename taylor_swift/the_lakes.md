[C] [e] [d] [a]


[C]Is it ro[e]mantic how all [d]my elegies [a]eulogize me?
[C]I'm not cut [e]out for all these [d]cynical clones
These [a]hunters with cell phones

    [e]Take me to the lakes, where all[F] the poets went to die
    I don't be[a]long and, my beloved, neither do[b] you
    [e]Those Windermere peaks look like[F] a perfect place to cry
    I'm setting [G]off, but not without my muse

[C]What should be[e] over burrowed [d]under my skin[a] in heart-stopping waves of hurt
[C]I've come too [e]far to watch some [d]name-dropping sleaze
Tell me[a] what are my Wordsworth

    [e]Take me to the lakes...

[C]I want auroras and [e]sad prose
[d]I want to watch wis[a]teria grow right [C]over my bare feet
'Cause [e]I haven't moved in [d]years
[a]And I want you right here
[C]A red rose [e]grew up out of [d]ice frozen ground
With [a]no one around to tweet it
[C]While I bathe in [e]cliff-side pools
With my ca[d]lamitous love and insur[a]mountable grief

    [e]Take me to the lakes...
    No, not without [C]you [e] [d] [a] [C] [e] [d] [a]
