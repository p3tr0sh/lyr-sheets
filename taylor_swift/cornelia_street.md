[C] [G] [a] [F]

We were in the [C]backseat
Drunk on something [G]stronger than the drinks in the [a]bar [F]
"I rent a place on Cornelia Street"
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home

    And I hope I never [C]lose you, hope it never [G]ends
    I'd never walk Cor[a]nelia Street a[F]gain
    That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
    I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
    And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
    And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
    I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
    I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

Windows flung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone

But then you [G]called, showed your hand
I turned a[a]round before I hit the tunnel
[F]Sat on the roof, you and I

    I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends

You hold my [G]hand on the street
Walk me [a]back to that apartment
Years a[F]go, we were just inside
Barefoot in the [G]kitchen
Sacred new be[a]ginnings
That became my re[F]ligion, listen

    [-]I hope I never lose you
    I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
    Oh, never again
    And baby, [C]I get mysti[G]fied by how this [a]city screams your name [F]
    And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
    I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
    I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

    I don't wanna lose you (Hope it never ends)
    I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
    I don't wanna lose you (Yeah)
