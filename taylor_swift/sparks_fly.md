|| [d] | [Bb] | [F] | [C] ||

[d]The way you move is like a [Bb]full-on rainstorm
[F]And I'm a house of [C]cards
You're the [d]kind of reckless
That should [Bb]send me runnin'
But I[F] kinda know that I [C]won't get far
[Bb]And you stood there in [C]front of me
Just [F]close e[C]nough to [d]touch
[Bb]Close enough to hope you couldn't [C]see
What I was thinking of

    Drop everything [d]now
    Meet me in the [Bb]pouring rain
    [F]Kiss me on the sidewalk
    [C]Take away the pain
    'Cause [d]I see [Bb]sparks fly when[F]ever you [C]smile
    Get me with those [d]green eyes, baby, as the [Bb]lights go down
    Give me [F]something that'll haunt me [C]when you're not around
    'Cause [d]I see [Bb]sparks fly when[F]ever you[C] sm[d]ile [Bb] [F] [C]

My mind forgets to remind me
You're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something,
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be.
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would...

    Drop everything now

I'll run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild.
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me
It's just wrong enough to make it feel right.
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show.

    Drop everything now

And the sparks fly...
Oh, baby, smile...
And the sparks fly...
