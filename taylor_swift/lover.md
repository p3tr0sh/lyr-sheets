[G]We could leave the [D0]Christmas lights up 't[C]il January
[G]This is our [D0]place, we make the [C]rules
And there's a [G]dazzling haze, a mys[D0]terious way a[C]bout you, dear
[G]Have I known you twenty [D0]seconds or twenty [C]years?

    Can [G]I go [D0]where you [C]go?
    Can we [G]always [D0]be this [C]close forever and ever?
    And [G]ah, take me [D0]out and take me [C]home
    You're [G]my, [D0]my, [e]my, [D]my [C]
    Lover

We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

    Can I go where you go?

[G]Ladies and gentlemen, [D0]will you please stand?
[e]With every guitar string [F]scar on my hand
[C]I take this magnetic [C/B]force of a man to be [a]my
[D]Lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be over-dramatic and true to my
Lover
And [G]you'll save all your [F]dirtiest jokes for [C]me
And at every [a]table, I'll save you a [D]seat
Lover

    Can I go where you go?
    Can we always be this close forever and ever?
    And ah, take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)
    You're my, my, my, my
    Oh, you're my, my, my, my
    Darling, you're my, my, my, my
    Lover
