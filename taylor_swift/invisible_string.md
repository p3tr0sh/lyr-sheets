[(1)]Green was the color of the grass where I used to read at Centennial Park
I used to think I would meet somebody there
Teal was the color of your shirt when you were 16 at the yogurt shop
You used to work at to make a little money

   [(2)]Time
   Curious time
   Gave me no compasses
   Gave me no signs
   Were there clues I didn't see?
   And isn't it just so pretty to think
   All along there was some
   Invisible string
   Tying you to [(1)]me?

[(1)]Bad was the blood of the song in the cab on your first trip to LA
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip getting lunch down by the Lakes
She said I looked like an American singer

   [(2)]Time
   Mystical time
   Cutting me open, then healing me fine
   Were there clues I didn't see?
   And isn't it just so pretty to think
   All along there was some
   Invisible string
   Tying you to [(1)]me?

A string that pulled me [(3)]
Out of all the wrong arms right into that dive bar
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Chains around my demons, wool to brave the seasons
One single thread of gold tied me to you [(1)]

[(1)]Cold was the steel of my axe to grind for the boys who broke my heart
Now I send their babies presents
Gold was the color of the leaves when I showed you around Centennial Park
Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven

   [(2)]Time
   Wondrous time                                              CAPO
   Gave me the blues and then purple pink skies              e|---|
   And it's cool                                             B|-2-|
   Baby with me                                              G|-2-|
