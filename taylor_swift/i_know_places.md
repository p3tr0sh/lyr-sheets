[a] [F] [d] [e]

[a]You stand with your [F]hand on my waistline
[d]It's a scene and we're [e]out here in plain sight
[a]I can hear them [F]whisper as we pass by
[d]It's a bad sign,[e] bad sign
[a]Something happens when [F]everybody finds out
[d]See the vultures [e]circling dark clouds
[a]Love's a fragile little [F]flame, it could burn out
[d]It could burn out [e]

Cause [a]they got the cages, [F]they got the boxes [d] [e]
And guns
[a]They are the hunters, [F]we are the foxes [d] [e]
And we run

    [C]Ba[G]by, [d]I know places we [F]won't be found
    And [C]they'll [G]be [d]chasing their tails tryin' to [F]track us down
    Cause [C][G]I[d], I know [F]places we can h[C][G][d]ide
    I know [F]places, [-]I know places

[a]Lights flash and we'll [F]run for the fences
[d]Let them say what they [e]want, we won't hear it
[a]Loose lips sink [F]ships all the damn time
[d]Not this time [-]

[a]Just grab my hand and [F]don't ever drop it [d] [e]
My love
[a]They are the hunters, [F]we are the foxes [d] [e]
And we run

    Baby, I know places we won't be found

[C]They are the hunters, [G]we are the fox[d]es
[F]And we run
[C]Just grab my hand and [G]don't ever drop [d]it
[F]My love

    Baby, I know places we won't be found

[C]They take their [G]shots, but we're bullet[d]proof
I know [F]places
[C]And you know for me,[G] it's always [d]you
I know [F]places
[C]In the dead of nig[G]ht, your eyes so gre[d]en
I know [F]places
[C]And I know for [G]you, it's always [d]me
I know [F]places
