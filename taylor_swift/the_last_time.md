| [G] [A] [b] [D] |

I [G]find myself at your door
[A]Just like all those times before
[b]I'm not sure how I got there
[D] All roadsâ€”they lead me here

[G]I imagine you are home
[A]In your room, all alone
And you [b]open your eyes into mine
And [D]everything feels better

    And [G]right be[A]fore your [b]eyes
    I'm [D]breaking, no [G]past
    No [A]reasons [b]why
    Just [D]you and m[A]e[G]

    [D]This is the last time I'm asking you [b]this
    Put my [A]name at the top of your [G]list
    This is the [D]last time I'm asking you [b]why
    You break my [A]heart in the blink of an [G]eye, eye, eye

You find yourself at my door
Just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave

And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better

    And right before your eyes
    I'm aching, no past
    Nowhere to hide
    Just you and me

    This is the last time...

This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong
This is the last time I say it's been you all along
This is the last time I let you in my door
This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore

Oh, oh, oh

    This is the last time...

    This is the last time I'm asking you
    Last time I'm asking you
    Last time I'm asking you this
    This is the last time I'm asking you
    Last time I'm asking you
    Last time I'm asking you this
    This is the last time I'm asking you
    Last time I'm asking you
    Last time I'm asking you this
    This is the last time I'm asking you
    Last time I'm asking you
    Last time I'm asking you this
