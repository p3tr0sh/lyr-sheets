| [Cadd9] [G] [Dsus4] [e7] |

[Cadd9]I remember when we broke [G]up the first time
[Dsus4]Saying, "This is it, I've had e[e7]nough," 'cause like
We [Cadd9]hadn't seen each other in a [G]month
When you [Dsus4]said you needed [e7]space. (What?)
[Cadd9]Then you come around again and [G]say
"Baby, I [Dsus4]miss you and I swear I'm gonna [e7]change, trust me."
Re[Cadd9]member how that lasted for a [G]day?
I say, "I [Dsus4]hate you," we break up, you [e7]call me, "I love you."

[Cadd9]Oo[G]h, we [Dsus4]called it off a[e7]gain last night
But [Cadd9]oo[G]h, [Dsus4]this time I'm [e7]telling you, I'm telling you

    [Cadd9]We are [G]never ever eve[Dsus4]r getting [e7]back together,
    [Cadd9]We are [G]never ever eve[Dsus4]r getting [e7]back together,
    [Cadd9]You go talk to [G]your friends, talk to [Dsus4]my friends, talk to [e7]me
    But [Cadd9]we are [G]never ever ever[Dsus4] ever[-] getting back to[Cadd9]gether

[G] Like,[Dsus4] ever... [e7]

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Ooh, you called me up again tonight
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Ooh, yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Oh oh oh

[-]I used to think that we were forever ever
And I used to say, "Never say never..."
[Cadd9] [G] [Dsus4] [e7]Uggg... so he calls me up and he's like, "I still love you,"
And I'm like... "I just... I mean this is exhausting, you know, like,
We are never getting back together. Like, ever"

No!

    We are never ever ever getting back together
    We are never ever ever getting back together
    You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
    But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

    We, ooh, getting back together, ohhh,
    We, ooh, getting back together

    You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (talk to me)
    But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
