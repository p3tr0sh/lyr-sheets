[D]Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
[A]I was in your sights, you got me alone
You [b]found me... [G]

I [D]guess you didn't care & I guess I liked that
And [A]when I fell hard, you took a step back
With[b]out me... [G]

[D]And he's long [A]gone when he's next to [b]me
And I realize[G] the blame is on me

    'Cause [b]I knew you were [G]trouble when you walked [A]in
    So [D]shame on [A]me n[b]ow
    Flew me to [G]places I'd never be[A]en
    So you [D]put me [A]down
    [b]I knew you were [G]trouble when you walked [A]in
    So [D]shame on [A]me n[b]ow
    Flew me to [G]places I'd never be[A]en
    Now I'm [D]lying on the [A]cold hard [b]ground

    Oh [G] Oh [A]
    Trouble [D]trouble [A]trouble
    [b] Oh [G] Oh [A]
    Trouble [D]trouble [A]trouble

[D]No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pre[A]tends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're [b]drowning... [G]

And I [D]heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A [A]new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And [b]now I see... [G]

[D]He was long [A]gone when he met [b]me
And I realize[G] the joke is on me

    I knew you were trouble...

When your [G]saddest fear comes [b]creeping in
That you [G]never loved me or her or [A]anyone or anything

    I knew you were trouble...

    I knew you were trouble when you walked in
    Trouble
    I knew you were trouble when you walked in
    Trouble
