I [G]climbed the Redwood [D]Hill
Twas [e]on a rainy [B]day
To [C]rise above the [G]throng
And [A]talk with Mother Nature for a [D]while

She [G]told me of her [D]love
For the [e]children in her [B]trust
And [C]of her grave con[G]cern
For the [A]likes of [C]you and me and [G]us

    [e]Crying thought she was
    She did [G]speak these tender words
    The [C]things that I [a]am
    [C]I could not change for any [D]man

I tried to comfort her
Ah but she would not be still
And how the rain did fall
As I found my way back down the Redwood Hill

    Crying though she was
    She did speak these tender words
    The things that I am
    I would not change for any man

I tried to comfort her
Ah but she would not be still
I'll not forget that day
When Mother Nature cried on Redwood Hill
I'll not forget that day
When Mother Nature cried on Redwood Hill
