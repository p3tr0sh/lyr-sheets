There is no [F]other to com[g]pare to you
You've got me [F]blinded, givin' all that I [g]have to you
You showed me [F]feelings that I'd [g]never find
But those [F]feelings ain't complete when you're not [Eb]here all [F]the time

    [g]Oh baby love, oh baby love
    Early in the morning, early in the morning
    You come creepin' in my mind
    Oh baby love, oh baby love
    
    Oh baby love, oh baby love
    I wake up with a yearning
    Burnin' for your touch, oh baby love

Give me reasons to be a fool for you
But I don't care about foolish pride when it's concerning to you
I'll be your slave, yes I will, give me your command
You can order me to stay around you all that I can

    Oh baby love, oh baby love...

    [g]Oh baby love, oh baby love
    I wake up with a yearning
    Burnin' for your touch, I'm burning
    [C]Burnin' for your touch, I'm burning
    [F]Burnin' for your touch, oh baby [g]love, oh

[g]All I do is think about you, baby love
All I do is think about you, baby love
I want your love, I need your love, I want your love
Come on now, oh babe

[C]
Hey
[D]

There is no other to compare to you
You've got me blinded, blinded, blinded, giving all I have to you
Feelings, feelings I'd never find
But those feelings ain't complete when you're not here all the time

    Oh baby love, baby love

    Oh baby love, oh baby love
    I wake up with a yearning
    Burnin' for your touch, oh baby love

    Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
    Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
    Shoop dub dooby dub shoop, baby love

    Burnin' for your touch
    [C]Burnin' for your touch
    [F]Burnin' for your touch, oh baby [g]love
    I walked a millions miles
    [C]On the milky way, yeah
    Just to [F]get into your arms, oh [g]baby love
    
You know i've got to...


[Bb]Ooh [C]baby
