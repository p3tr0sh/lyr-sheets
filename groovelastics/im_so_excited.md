Tonight's the night we're gonna make it happen
Tonight we'll put all other things aside
Give in this time and show me some affection
We're goin' for those pleasures in the night

> Prechorus ; 12 ; | a | a | g | d7 | a | a | g | d7 | c | d | F |

I want to love you, feel you
Wrap myself around you
I want to squeeze you, please you
I just can't get enough
And if you move real slow, I'll let it go

> Chorus ; 12 ; | g | g | Eb | Eb | Eb | F | x2

I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know I want you

> Verse 2 ; 16

We shouldn't even think about tomorrow
Sweet memories will last a long, long time
We'll have a good time, baby, don't you worry
And if we're still playin' around, boy, that's just fine

> Chorus * ; 12

Let's get excited, we just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it
I'm so excited and I just can't hide it
And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I want you, I want you

And if you move real slow, I'll let it go

I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
I'm about to lose control and I think I like it

I want you, I want you

Look what you do to me, you got me burning up
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Ow
How did you get to me? I've got to give it up
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Ow

And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, want you, I want you!)
I want you, I want you!
