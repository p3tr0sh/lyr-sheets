You are all I ever wanted
All I ever thought I'd need
Broke it off before we started
Didn't know what to believe

> Pre-Chorus ; 2 ; | [e] | [f#] |
Maybe I love you
Maybe I hate you

> Chorus ; 8 ; | [G] | [A] | [b] | [f#] | x2
    There is something in your eyes that leaves me paralyzed
    Terrified that you love me better than anyone else
    Are you here to save my life, or the devil in disguise?
    Terrified that you love me better than anyone else before

> Post-Chorus ; 8 ; Panflöte, Bläser
Terrified that you love me better
Terrified that you love me
Love me better

> Verse ; 8 ; mit Gitarre
Tried to keep you on the outside
But now you're underneath my skin
And I can feel your eyes are on me
Oh, the lights are going dim
