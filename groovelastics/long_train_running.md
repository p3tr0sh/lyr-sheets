[g7]Down around the corner half a mile from here
See them long trains runnin' and you watch 'em disappear

    Without [c7]lo[c6]ve
    Where would you be [g]now?
    without [Eb]lo[D4][D]ve

You know I saw Miss Lucy down along the tracks
She lost her home and her family and she won't be coming back

    Without love
    Where would you be right now?
    without love

Well the Illinois Central and the Southern Central freight
Got to keep on pushin' mama 'Cause you know they're runnin' late

    Without love
    Where would you be now-na-na now?
    without love

Well the Illinois Central and the Southern Central freight
Got to keep on pushin' mama 'Cause you know they're runnin' late

    Without love
    Where would you be now?
    without love

Well pistons keep on churnin' and the wheels go 'round and 'round
And the steel rails lie cold and hard on the mountains they go down

    Without love
    Where would you be right now?
    without love, Ooh
