Easy lover
She'll get a hold on you believe it
She's like no other
Before you know it you'll be on your knees
She's an easy lover
She'll take your heart but you won't feel it
She's like no other
And I'm just trying to make you see

> Verse 1 ; 16 ; | C x4 | e x4 | C x4 | e x4 |
She's the kind of girl you dream of
Dream of keeping hold of
You'd better forget it
You'll never get it
She will play around and leave you
Leave you and deceive you
Better forget it
Oh you'll regret it

> Pre-Chorus ; 8 + 1 ; | a | b e | x3 | F | F | C D |
No you'll never change her, so leave it, just leave it
Get out quick 'cause seeing is believing
It's the only way
You'll ever know

> Chorus ; 16

> Verse 2 ; 16
You're the one that wants to hold her
Hold her and control her
You'd better forget it
You'll never get it
Oh, she will say that there's no other
Till she finds another
Better forget it
Oh you'll regret it

> Pre-Chorus ; 14 ; | a | b e | x3 | F | F | e | e | F | F | e | C D |
Don't try to change her, just leave it, just leave it
You're not the only one, oh seeing is believing
It's the only way
That you'll ever know, aah

> Solo ; 16 ; Chorus

> Pre-Chorus ; 8 + 1
Don't try to change her, just leave it, just leave it
You're not the only one, oh seeing is believing
It's the only way
You'll ever know

> Chorus ; 16
She's an easy lover
She'll get a hold on you believe it
She's like no other
Before you know it you'll be on your knees
She's an easy lover
She'll take your heart but you won't feel it
She's like no other
And I'm just trying to make you see
