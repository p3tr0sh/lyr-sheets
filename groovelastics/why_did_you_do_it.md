[b]I've been thinking 'bout what you have done to me
The damage is much deeper than you'll ever see
Hit me like a hammer to my head
I wonder were you pushed or were you led?

    [e]Why did you do it? Why did you do that thing to [b]me?
    [e]Why did you do it? Why did you do that thing to [b]me?
    [e]The only one who knows the truth,
    [F#]Man it's him me and you.

My friends they listen to the things i say
They listen and they hear more everyday
But i know they never understand it
Because it was no accident you planned it.

    Why did you do it...
