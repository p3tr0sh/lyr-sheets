> Verse 1 ; 8 ; Keys

I know I was a fool to think that you would wait for me
Why did I let you go?
But I can't help but find your picture one more time to see
Your face light up my phone

> Pre-Chorus ; 4 ; Keys

I don't know what the future will be holding
All I know is I want to be holding you

> Chorus ; 8 ; Drums, Git

    No, I didn't think I needed your love
    But, you're the only one that I've been thinking of
    I'll do anything to get back your love
    Say that you want me, say that you want me back

> Lauf ; 8

> Verse 2 ; 8 ; über Lauf

Just tell me what I gotta do to get you in my life
Just like we were before
Before I quit, I lost my grip, I let you slip
Out into the night, and watched you close the door

> Pre-Chorus ; 4 ; Drums, Keys

> Chorus ; 16 ; | [C] | [E] [B] | [C] | [E] [B] | [C] | [E] [B] | [A] | [E] [D] |

    No, I didn't think I needed your love
    But, you're the only one that I've been thinking of
    I'll do anything to get back your love
    Say that you want me, say that you want me back
    No, I didn't think I needed your love
    But, now I don't think I could ever get enough
    I'll do anything to get back your love
    Say that you want me, say that you want me back
