    It keeps turning me. [a]
    Upside [d]down.
    It keeps pulling me. [a]
    Under[d]ground. [E]

[a]Love is like gravity[G].
It pulls me down equall[A]y.
And draws me back every ti[Bb]me.
This love is a heavy kind[F].
That love is my enem[G]y.
I keep it close. Close to [A]me.
And I forget the pain it caused[Bb].
It's better to have loved and lost.

    [g]This love [E]has no [A]alibi.
    [g]Still it [E]feeds my [A]appetite.

    It keeps turning me... 2x

One and one is always two.
I apologize for how I treated you.
Nonetheless, I believe.
That this will be the death of me.
Sunrise, and nightfall.
I'm back behind. Behind it all.
And I will wait, I will take my time.
Patience is a friend of mine.

    Your love has no alibi.
    Still I fuel my appetite.

    It keeps turning me... 2x

    Consequences haunting me.
    Still I follow helplessly.

    It keeps turning me... 2x
