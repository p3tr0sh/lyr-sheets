[a]On a [E]wagon [a]bound for [E]market
[a]There's a [d]calf with a [a]mournful [E]eye
[a]High a[E]bove him [a]there's a [E]swallow
[a]Winging [d]swiftly [a]through [E]the [a]sky

    [G]How the winds are [C]laugh[a]ing
    [G]They laugh with all their [C]might
    [G]Laugh and laugh the [C]whole day [a]through
    [E]And half the summer's [a]night

    [E]Donna, Donna, Donna, [a]Donna
    [G]Donna, Donna, Donna, [C]Do
    [E]Donna, Donna, Donna, [a]Donna
    [E]Donna, Donna, Donna, [a]Do

"Stop complaining!" said the farmer,
"Who told you a calf to be?
Why don't you have wings to fly with,
like the swallow so proud and free?"

    How the winds ...

Calves are easily bound and slaughtered,
never knowing the reason why.
But whoever treasures freedom,
like the swallow has learned to fly.

     How the winds ...
