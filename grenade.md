[d]Easy come, easy go That's just how you live, oh
[a]Take, take, take it all But you never give
[d]Should've known you was trouble From the first kiss
Had your [a]eyes wide open [A]Why were they open?

    [d]Gave you all I had And you tossed it in the trash
    You [a]tossed it in the trash, you did
    To [d]give me all your love is all I ever asked
    [a]'Cause what you don't under[A]stand is...

    I'd catch a gre[d]nade for you ([Bb]yeah, [F]yeah, yeah)
    Throw my [C]hand on a [d]blade for you ([Bb]yeah, [F]yeah, yeah)
    I'd jump in [C]front of a [d]train for you ([Bb]yeah, [F]yeah, yeah)
    You know I'd [C]do any[d]thing for you ([Bb]yeah, [F]yeah, [C]yeah)
    Oh, I would [Bb]go through all this [C]pain
    Take a [F]bullet straight [A]through my [d]brain
    [C]Yes, I would [Bb]die for you, baby
    [A]But you won't do the same

[d] [d] [a]No, no, no, no[a]

Black, black, black and blue Beat me 'til I'm numb
Tell the devil I said "Hey" when you get back to where you're from
Mad woman, bad woman That's just what you are
Yeah, you'll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car

    Gave you all I had

    I'd catch a grenade for you (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[g] If my body was on fire
[d] Oh, you'd watch me burn down in flames
[g] You said you loved me, you're a liar
'Cause you never,[A] ever,[A] ev[A]er did, baby

[d] [d] [d] But, [A]darling, I'd still catch a gre[d]nade for you...

[d] No, you won't do the s[a]ame
You wouldn't do the s[d]ame
Oh, you'd never do the s[a]ame
Oh, no no no, oh
