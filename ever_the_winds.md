As [a]I went a [G]walking way [a]down by the [e]greenwood
[C]Down where the [G]ivy and [a]laurel [e]entwine
I [a]heard a bird [G]singing a [a]sad, plaintive [e]love song
He [a]mourned for his [e]true love as I mourned for [a]mine


    [C]Ever the [G]winds keep on [a]changing their [e]journey
    [C]Ever the waves keep on [a]changing the [e]sea
    [C]Ever green [G]summer keeps [a]changing to [e]autumn
    My [a]true love has [e]changed, but there's no change in [a]me

I brought my love flowers all tied up with ribbons
Soon the sweet flowers were faded and gone
Like the flowers, my true love's affections have withered
Which leaves me alone here to pine and to mourn

Chorus

My constant companions are sadness and sorrow
Trouble has never forsaken me yet
But wherever I go 'til my days are all numbered
The love of my soul, I will never forget

Chorus
