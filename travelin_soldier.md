[G]Two days past eighteen
He was waiting for the bus in his army green
Sat [C]down in a booth in a cafe there
Gave his [G]order to a girl with a bow in her hair
He's a little shy so she gives him a smile
And he said, "Would you mind sittin' down for a while
And [C]talking to me?
I'm feeling a little [G]low."
She said, "I'm [a]off in an hour and I [C]know where we can [G]go."

So they went down and they sat on the pier
He said I bet you got a boyfriend but I don't care
I [C]got no one to send a letter [G]to
Would you [a]mind if I sent [C]one back here to [G]you

    [e]I cried
    [C]Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
    [G]Too young for him they told her
    [D]Waitin' for the love of a travelin' soldier
    [e]Our love will never end
    [C]Waitin' for the soldier to come back again
    [G]Never more to be alone when the [D]letter said
    A soldier's coming [G]home

So the letters came from an army camp
In California then Vietnam
And he told her of his heart
It might be love and all of the things he was so scared of
He said, "When it's getting kinda rough over here,
I think of that day sittin' down at the pier.
And I close my eyes and see your pretty smile.
Don't worry but I won't be able to write for awhile."

      I cried ...

One Friday night at a football game
The Lord's Prayer said and the Anthem sang
A man said, "Folks would you bow your heads
For a list of local Vietnam dead."
Crying all alone under the stands
Was a piccolo player in the marching band
And one name read but nobody really cared
But a pretty little girl with a bow in her hair

    I cried ... 2x
