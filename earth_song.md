[g]What about [C]sunrise?
[g]What about [C]rain?
[g]What about [C]all the things
That you [D]said we were to gain?

What about killing fields?
Is there a time?
What about all the things
That you said was yours and mine?

    Did you [D#]ever stop to [F]notice
    All the [Bb]blood we've shed be[g]fore?
    Did you [c]ever stop to notice
    This crying [D]Earth, this weeping shore?

A-ha[g]ha[C]aaaaaah [g] [C] Oo[g]oo[C]oooooh [g] [C]
A[g]aa[C]aaaaaah [g] [C] Oo[g]oo[C]oooooh [D]

What have we done to the world?
Look what we've done
What about all the peace
That you pledge your only son?

What about flowering fields?
Is there a time?
What about all the dreams
That you said was yours and mine?

    Did you ever stop to notice
    All the children dead from war?
    Did you ever stop to notice
    This crying Earth, this weeping shore?

Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh

    I used to dream
    I used to glance beyond the stars
    Now I don't know where we are
    Although I know we've drifted far

Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh

Hey, what about yesterday?
What about the seas?
Heavens are falling down
I can't even breathe

What about apathy?
I need you
What about nature's worth?
It's our planet's womb

What about animals?
Turned kingdoms to dust?
What about elephants?
Have we lost their trust?

What about crying whales
Ravaging the seas?
What about forest trails
Burnt despite our pleas?

What about the holy land
Torn apart by creed?
What about the common man?
Can't we set him free?

What about children dying?
Can't you hear them cry?
Where did we go wrong?
Someone tell me why

What about baby boy?
What about the days?
What about all their joy?
What about the man?

What about the crying man?
What about Abraham?
What about death again?
Do we give a damn!

Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh
Aaaaaaaaah Oooooooooh
