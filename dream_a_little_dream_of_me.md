[C]Stars [B7]shining bright a[Ab]bove [G]you
[C]Night [B7]breezes [Bb7]seem to [A7]whisper 'I love you'.
[F]Birds singing in the [f]sycamore tree.
[C]Dream a little [Ab]dream of [G]me.

[C]Say [B7]nighty-night and [Ab]kiss [G]me
[C]Just [B7]hold me [Bb7]tight and [A7]tell me you'll miss me.
[F]While I'm alone and [f]blue as can be,
[C]Dream a little [Ab]dream [G]of [C]me.[E7]

    [A]Stars [f#]fading but [b]I linger [E7]on, dear -
    [A]Still [f#]craving your [b]kiss.[E7]
    [A]I'm [f#]longing to [b]linger till [E7]dawn, dear,
    [A]Just saying [Ab]th[G]is...

[C]Sweet [B7]dreams till sunbeams [Ab]find [G]you -
[C]Sweet [B7]dreams that [Bb7]leave all [A7]worries behind you.
[F]But in your dreams, what[f]ever they be,
[C]Dream a little [Ab]dream [G]of [C]me.[E7]

    [A]Stars [f#]fading but [b]I linger [E7]on, dear -
    [A]Still [f#]craving your [b]kiss.[E7]
    [A]I'm [f#]longing to [b]linger till [E7]dawn, dear,
    [A]Just saying [Ab]th[G]is...

[C]Sweet [B7]dreams till sunbeams [Ab]find [G]you -
[C]Sweet [B7]dreams that [Bb7]leave all [A7]worries far behind you.
[F]But in your dreams, what[f]ever they be,
[C]Dream a little [Ab]dream [G]of [C]me.

Da[B7]dada...
